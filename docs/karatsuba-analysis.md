# Algorithm analyses
Now let's analyze the complexity of the Karatsuba algorithm.

[1. Cyclomatic complexity analysis](#cyclomatic-complexity-analysis)
[2. Asymptotic complexity analysis](#asymptotic-complexity-analysis)

## Cyclomatic complexity analysis  
o Represent the control flow of the function.  
o Structure the flow graph (nodes and edges).  
o Calculate the cyclomatic complexity using the formula 𝑀 = 𝐸 − 𝑁 + 2𝑃, 
where:  
§ 𝐸: Number of edges in the graph.  
§ 𝑁: Number of nodes in the graph.  
§ 𝑃: Number of connected components in the graph (in a single 
program, 𝑃 = 1). 

## Asymptotic complexity analysis
o Determine the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
o Identify the three main cases: best case, average case, and worst case.
