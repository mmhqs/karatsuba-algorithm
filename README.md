# Karatsuba Algorithm

This repo presents a Python implementation of the Karastsuba algorithm.

## Who's the guy?
[Anatoli Alexeievitch Karatsuba](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Alexeievitch_Karatsuba) was a russian mathematician who created a method to multiply two natural numbers, way faster than the traditional multiplication methods. The called Karastsuba algorithm started a new class of divide and conquer algorithms.

## The math behind the algorithm
First of all: the math.

To understand the math behind the algorithm, I did some studying and compiled my research in the [karatsuba-study](docs\karatsuba-study.md) file.

## The algorithm
Finally, the Karatsuba algorithm, implemented in Python, can be found in [main.py](code\main.py) file.
